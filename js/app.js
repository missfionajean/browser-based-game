SWOON!

- Five re-rollable dice with the love languages and a SWOON!
- SWOON!s don't do anything on their own, so it's risky to go for it.
- You get set up with a girl via a dating-app style interface, where you learn a little about her (it's your job to deduce which love languages she likes).
- On your date, you have a certain amount of chances to make a big impression, but luck might make things go sour, or there might be a random event that shakes things up.
- You go through your (let's say) five chances and see how the date went, determining whether you get another date?
- Date #2 would be a harder version of the date with higher stakes?
- Win condition would be for her to be your girlfriend/boyfriend/etc?
- So, I suppose the menu is the dating app, but it doesn't have a ton of info and you learn as you go what they like and don't?


What does this game need?
- Dating app interface menu
- Dice elements (animation can just be cycling through the faces)
- Three chance structure with hold buttons and re-roll button
- Special effect on full SWOON! (i.e. you take a big swing and it works!)
- Otherwise, the thing you do is based on the situation. They like certain things better than others, but doing the same thing over and over has diminishing returns?
- Simple art (even silhouettes) for the people you date
- Scenarios for the dates (make it more akin to boyfriend dungeon)
- Some way to affect your chances as you go (class or change die faces, etc?)
- Variables that store your overall progress with a person between dates. (Maybe you even get to choose what you wear and that has an effect?)

Die Faces:
Words of Affirmation (Speech Bubble)
Physical Touch (Holding Hands)
Quality Time (Clock Face)
Acts of Service (Dinner Plate)
Gift Giving (Gift Box)
SWOON! (Heart)

MAYBE MAKE IT MORE GENERAL, LIKE BE FUNNY, SMART, EMOTIONAL, etc?
Then the dice can be weighted certain ways based on a self-profile at the beginning of the game?

Point Calculation:
-100 points per majority face
-50 points per SWOON! (750 total if full set)
-Multipliers (Based on Personality) - Love (1.5), Like (1.2), Neutral (1.0), Dislike (0.8), Hate (0.5)
-Situation Bonus - Each date event will have a choice based on the event, with some making slightly more sense than others (awarding a small flat bonus to your post-multiplier score) [NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ONE]
-Maybe FUNNY, CLEVER and SWEET
