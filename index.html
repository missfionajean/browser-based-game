				Swoon!<span id="tm">TM</span> is a dating-sim where your actions
				are determined by a roll of the dice. After our flawless
				algorithm sets you up on your perfect date, you will be led
				through a series of events. How you respond to each situation is
				determined by a dice roll attempt.
			</p>
			<p>
				When faced with a decision moment, click "Roll the dice!" to
				generate a random roll. You are allowed three attempts at each
				roll and you can even lock in faces you'd like to keep between
				attempts! When you're happy with your roll - or you're out of
				attempts (it's okay, we all get nervous and fumble over our
				words) - click "Make your move!" to advance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The symbol showing on the majority of your dice during your last
				attempt will determine how you act. (A random choice will be
				made if there is a tie; indecision does not facilitate romance!)
				The result will affect the opinion of your date. More matching
				faces means a stronger move. Depending on the event and their
				personality, certain moves will even be more effective than
				others. Do well enough and you'll earn a second date!

						>TM</span
					>
					When this meter hits five hearts, it will trigger a
					swoonworthy moment that will score you BIG points with your
					date! Be careful, though. The heart is not worth any points
					by itself, so choose to lock them in wisely.
