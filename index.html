				Swoon!<span id="tm">TM</span> is a dating-sim where your actions
				are determined by a roll of the dice. After our flawless
				algorithm sets you up on your perfect date, you will be led
				through a series of events. How you respond to each situation is
				determined by a dice roll attempt.
			</p>
			<p>
				When faced with a decision moment, click "Roll the dice!" to
				generate a random roll. You are allowed three attempts at each
				roll and you can even lock in faces you'd like to keep between
				attempts! When you're happy with your roll - or you're out of
				attempts (it's okay, we all get nervous and fumble over our
				words) - click "Make your move!" to advance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The symbol showing on the majority of your dice during your last
				attempt will determine how you act. (A random choice will be
				made if there is a tie; indecision does not facilitate romance!)
				The result will affect the opinion of your date. More matching
				faces means a stronger move. Do well enough and you'll earn a second date!
			</p>

					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					One last thing... The signature Swoon!<span id="tm">TM</span> heart represents little moments of unspoken flirting. Each one showing when you "Make your move!" will fill the Swoon-O-Meter!<span id="tm"
						>TM</span
					> Five hearts will trigger a special swoonworthy moment at the end of your date that can tip the scales in your favor! The moment will also be better the stronger your date feels.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dating Tip: There's nothing wrong with flirting, but it won't mean much without substance to back it up. Just because you have chemistry doesn't mean you've made a personal connection. A great date has both. Balance them well and you'll get that second date!
